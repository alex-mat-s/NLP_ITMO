To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\\n\\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \\n\\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.\",\"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle.

Think of Orthodox Jewish women and you will get the picture. The practice in Paul's day for Jewish women to cover their hair was about the same as it is today. It is a sign of the power of God over their lives, just as the yarmulke (kippah / skullcap) is a sign of God's authority over men. It is a sign of respect.\\n\\nYes it is a sign of authority, but not in the way the church would normally take it.  A careful reading shows that a man doesn't have any authority above him except for Messiah. There is not supposed to be a \"covering\" over him like a pastor, bishop, archbishop, cardinal, pope, priest or rabbi.  All of these are unneeded. The concept of a hierarchy that the church has established over people is unbiblical.  Each of us are to be independant thinkers!\\n\\nMessiah is the head over the Body. He has authority over the Bride. Similarly the husband is to excercise the same sort of loving authority over his household. Messiah is not a tyrant and the husband is not to be a tyrant over his household either.  Way too many men over the years have gotten that wrong.  They look upon their wives and families as slaves, servants, etc, instead of as helpers and advisors. The person answer above who claimed that women didn't get respect is incorrect. Read Proverbs 31:10-31 about how the virtuous woman was viewed. There is no disrespect there. She make decisions to purchase property on her own, she is a good business woman. This passage, called Aishyt Chayl is read by the husband to the wife every week at the beginning of the Sabbath in a Jewish home.\\n\\nMany Christians dispensationalize this passage and say that it was for the culture of Paul or Corinth but is not for our culture today.  But the verse which you cite doesn't speak of human culture, rather it speaks of angels. To dismiss the command in this way is to claim that the \"culture\" of the angels has changed.  So my own belief is that the command is still in effect.\\n\\nThe second way in which this command is dismissed by many Christians is to say that the covering is a woman's long hair. This is based on their understanding of verse 15.  However, verse 6 would appear to deny that since it says if she doesn't wear the covering she should have her head shaved. So a woman who doesn't have long hair should have her head shaved until she gets long hair? No, of course not. Rather it is a scarf that she wears over her hair, and if she doesn't wear the scarf, she is to shave her head as well.\\n\\nSome will claim that the command is only to a married woman. But I will point out that verse 5 says \"every woman\", not \"every wife\". It is a general command and is not specifically for married women. The scarf is a symbol of the power and authority she has in Messiah, whether she has an earthly husband or not.\\n\\nThe fact that women cover their hair is also attested to in Numbers 5:18. The fact that women always covered their hair is widely attested to in regards to the women of Israel. Paul was speaking to the formerly pagan women of Corinth and giving them general instruction in the reason why this was done amoung the women of Israel.\\n\\nAs to whether you choose to start wearing a scarf, that is between you and God. Hopefully this will help you to arrive at the correct understanding of the passage.\",\"Good luck.

Instead, they say the film is historically inaccurate because Jesus is portrayed as a white man, not a black man.\\n\\n\"Strangely absent from the debate is one very basic inaccuracy which has been long promoted in order to bolster white supremacy and maintain a revisionist history that is beneficial to only people of European descent,\" said Malik Z. Shabazz, national chairman of the New Black Panther Party in a statement Tuesday.\\n\\n\"This purposely omitted fact is that Jesus was not a European white man. Jesus Christ was a black man - a dark skinned Hebrew Israelite from Northern Africa and even the only Biblical physical description confirms this (Rev. 13:20),\" said Shabazz in a statement..\\n\\nChapter 13 of the Book of Revelations only ends with verse 18. After CNSNews.com contacted the New Black Panther Party to clarify the Bible verse they referenced, Imam Akbar, national minister for the New Black Panther Party, explained that the original reference was a typo on their original press release.\\n\\nAkbar instead, pointed to Revelations 1:14 and 1:15 as well as Daniel 10:6.\\n\\n\"His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.\" (Rev. 1:14 and 1:15)\\n\\n\"His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.\" (Daniel 10:6)\\n\\n\"Not only does this film wrongfully depict Christ as white but all the disciples and Israelites are people of European descent, which presents a historical and physical impossibility,\" Shabazz added.\\n\\nThe New Black Panther Party and other black activists plan to stage protests nationwide over the controversy. Not only does the group claim the movie is \"false,\" but also \"harmful and racist.\"\\n\\nThe Anti-Defamation League recently expressed to Gibson its concern that the film would drum up anti-Semetism. Shabazz said his group disagrees with the ADL's claims that the film is \"anti-semetic\" and challenged the ADL to \"deny the historical accuracy of the Jews' attack on Christ.\"\\n\\nBut Shabazz says, the \"true controversy\" surrounding the film \"lies in the maligned history of African people through the world and the continual inaccuracies presented in every Hollywood production to date of any Biblical story from the 10 Commandments to the Christmas Story.\"\\n\\n\"These false images presented are 'anti-black' and these false images and interpretations only seek to further the racist and white supremist idea that God and Jesus Christ 'The Messiah' or 'Savior' is European and white,\" he added.\\n\\n\"This is clearly one more example of how black people in this country are treated unfairly. Black/African history has and continues to be misrepresented, black people worldwide are subjected to the psychologically abusive images of white supremacy and have no collective voice to defend or promote a Black agenda,\" Shabazz concluded.\\n\\nMovie 'not racist,' says black conservative\\n\\nBut Rev.

The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.  \\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly.

It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our \"fight or flight\" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. <br />\\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the \"fight or flight\" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. \\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. \\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush.

Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments.

Contrary to much popular belief, these are not the twelve days before Christmas, but in most of the Western Church are the twelve days from Christmas until the beginning of Epiphany  (January 6th; the 12 days count from December 25th until January 5th). In some traditions, the first day of Christmas begins on the evening of December 25th but the following day is considered the First Day of Christmas (December 26th).\\n\\nThe origin of the Twelve Days is complicated, and is related to differences in calendars, church traditions, and ways to observe this holy day in various cultures (see Christmas).  In the Western church, Epiphany is traditionally celebrated as the time the three Wise Men or Magi arrived to present gifts to the young Jesus (Matt. 2:1-12). In some cultures, especially Hispanic and Latin American culture, January 6th is observed as Three Kings Day, or simply the Day of the Kings (Span: la Fiesta de Reyes, el Dia de los Tres Reyes, or el Dia de los Reyes Magos; Dutch: Driekoningendag).  Even though December 25th is celebrated as Christmas in these cultures, January 6th is often the day for giving gifts. In some places it is traditional to give Christmas gifts for each of the Twelve Days of Christmas. Since Eastern Orthodox traditions use a different religious calendar, they celebrate Christmas on January 7th and observe Epiphany or Theophany on January 19th.\\n\\nBy the 16th century, some European and Scandinavian cultures had combined the Twelve Days of Christmas with (sometimes pagan) festivals celebrating the changing of the year. These were usually associated with driving away evil spirits for the start of the new year. \\n\\nThe Twelfth Night is January 5th, the last day of the Christmas Season before Epiphany (January 6th). In some church traditions, January 5th is considered the eleventh Day of Christmas, while the evening of January 5th is still counted as the Twelfth Night, the beginning of the Twelfth day of Christmas the following day.  Twelfth Night often included feasting along with the removal of Christmas decorations. French and English celebrations of Twelfth Night included a King's Cake, remembering the visit of the Three Magi, and ale or wine (a King's Cake is part of the observance of Mardi Gras in French Catholic culture of the Southern USA).  In some cultures, the King's Cake was part of the celebration of the day of Epiphany.\"],[\"Different dialects of English have different standards.  Standard American English is the standard for many Americans, but British people have a different standard, and so forth.  So American English isn't really the standard for everyone (although it is for many if they have economic or cultural ties to the United States).\\n\\nAs for how the standard evolved, there have always been standards.  In general, the dialect of whoever's in power is considered the standard, because people want to be like that powerful group.  Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power.  What's interesting, though, is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it doesn't belong to a particular region.\\n\\nThe Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today.  They were British, but in the meantime English has evolved in both places.\",\"dear qween\\nthere is an instinct in humankind half sexual desire half love which is called passion.this attracts two people of opposite sexand they starts a friendship.As time passes by they want to figure id the newly started friendship is a love or sex and the only way to figure out the answer is to play the game(sleep withur partner).If you feel love after sex u would get ur friendship was a love type otherwise if u get empty or even disgusted it would be a signpost of sex only relationship.So u see sex is so usefull for distinguishing a real love.\\nbye\\nnima\",\"How to suspend/delete a sub account\\nFor All Applications, All Operating Systems, and All Domains\\n\\nImportant: During the 90 day suspension period, you may reactivate the suspended sub account.\\n\\n \\nAfter 90 days, the suspended sub account will be deleted.

Some smaller bodies such as asteroids or Mars moons Phobos and Deimos, do have odd shapes, but larger bodies like the nine planets and most of their moons do look like spheres.  That's because of the nature of gravity.  You can think of gravity as a force that points inward toward the center of the planet so that every part of the surface is pulled evenly toward the center, resulting in a spherical shape. \\nOf course, planets are not perfect spheres because mountains and valleys and even skyscrapers are all deviations from the spherical shape.  However, as planets get larger, gravity gets stronger, until eventually large objects on the surface are crushed under their own weight.  That's why we don't have mountains that are 50 miles high or skyscrapers that are 2,000 stories tall.  Planets stay basically spherical because any large deviations get crushed. \\n\\nAlthough gravity keeps planets close to spherical, there are other forces that cause deviations from the basic spherical shape.  For example, the rotation of the earth once every 24 hours, causes an apparent centrifugal force which creates a bulge at the equator.  In fact the earth's diameter at the equator is 7,926 miles while the diameter between the poles is only 7,900.\",\"Is your mind real or are you simply imagining things while you breathe?\\n\\nGhosts are spirits manifested in shapeless translucence to become visible to our earthly eyes...\",...,\"Dwight David Eisenhower \\nBirth Place: Denison, Texas.\\nDate of Birth: October 14, 1890 \\n34th US President from January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961.\\n\\nLyndon Baines Johnson \\nBirth Place   : Gillespie County, Texas \\nDate of Birth : August 27, 1908 \\n36th US President From November 22, 1963 – January 20, 1969.\",\"There is a study that says that caffeine helps with Parkinson's.

Many events are not remembered at all. Some events are remembered initially but later gradually forgotten. \\n\\nA trigger (e.g. an article in a newspaper, a photograph of a friend etc) might bring back a recently forgotten memory. However, most events eventually become permanently lost and can never be retrieved. \\n\\nIt is impossible for the brain to store complete details of every event. It simply does not have the storage capacity to hold that amount of data. Rather, only a minimal amount of information is actually stored in the brain. \\n\\nWhen we recall a memory, our mind will automatically \"flesh out\" the recollection by inventing details of the event, based on previous similar experiences. This process is largely unconscious; we are not generally aware of it happening. \\n\\nOne interesting phenomenon can occur when the memory is being recalled as a result of questions by a therapist or interrogator. Their suggestive questions can distort this \"fleshing out\" process. The mind can add new components to the memory that are unrelated to the original event. Even more interestingly, these distortions will later re-enter the client's memory, and will probably emerge during subsequent recalls.\",\"The Straight Dope says, \"To tell you the truth, nobody really knows.

Some people may tolerate certain indisgressions and some may not.  The degree of tolerance is a very important aspect that can determine how much anger a person can, or may feel, and also may indicate how much control of anger a person can manage.  Maturity, Self-confidence, discipline, psychological and emotional fitness, may establish a person's ability to control his or her anger, and cope with it. Violence is anger without control and without proper logic. It is a pure irrational physical interpretation of one's fear, insecurity and vulnerability. Coping with anger is dependent on the person's abilility to figure things out for himself/herself and resolve his/her anger by using proper logic and discipline in managing ones emotional state. Often we seek advice from trusted acquiantances, just be careful, and think of what advise is being given, because they are mainly opinions of someone who may not really understand what you may be feeling, or angry about in the first place, it is very hard to assume that anyone person can help you with your anger. It is good to share your thoughts about your anger with someone you trust, but you cannot expect them to solve your anger. Only you can exercise proper rationality on your own anger and try to resolve it without violence by having self-confidence, disciplne, mature rationality, knowing what is good to do, and not to do something bad.

With the idea of terrorism in everybody's mind, especially the idealist Bush's mind, security and defense became priorities. In addition, with his ear turned to Karl Rove, Bush was controlled by the whims of the \"neoconservatives,\" a block of politicians, not even necessarily Republican who believed in the democratization of the Middle East.

The pastors of the different churches have to make some excuse as to why there are over 600,000 different christian denominations though. Those pastors of the churches wanted to be able to \"guide\" what their following believed in. Only by proclaming the bible is perfect, and themsevles, the pastors the most educated (supposedly), were the best ones who could interpret the scriptures to what they \"really meant\". This is why so many christian believes change all the time throught history. Also why those believes are the most popular of the day.

John (who wrote revelations) hadn't even written the Gospel of John yet when he wrote revelations. According to christian doctrine then the book of John would not be allowed. Of course christians also don't realize that the bible was not put together for several hundred years after the apostles died. \\nThere is a like scripture in Deuteronomy 4:2 \"ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your God which I command you\".\\n\\nIf christians interpreted this the same way as they did revelations all books, revelations, everything would end after Moses.

Another way of expressing this is, Abandon negative action; create perfect virtue; subdue your own mind. This is the teaching of the Buddha. By abandoning negative actions (killing, etc.) and destructive motivations (anger, attachment, close-mindedness, etc.), we stop harming ourselves and others. By creating perfect virtue, we develop beneficial attitudes, like impartial love and compassion, and do actions motivated by these thoughts. By subduing our mind, we cut away all false projections, thus making ourselves calm and peaceful by understanding reality.\\n\\nThe essence of Buddha’s teachings is also contained in the three principles of the path: definite emergence, the dedicated heart and wisdom realizing emptiness. Initially, we seek definitely to emerge from the confusion of our problems and their causes. Then, we see that other people also have problems, and with love and compassion, we dedicate our heart to becoming a Buddha so that we are capable of helping others extensively. In order to do this, we develop the wisdom understanding the real nature of ourselves and other phenomena.\",\"Some dude was posting links to really gross, traumatizing anal-old man porn and I get voilation for calling someones immigration \"solution\" 'Silly\".

Your house was merely the security for the loan.  Lenders are in the business to make money - \"forgiveness\" is not usually a business term.  \\n\\nExample:\\n\\nLets say you had a mortgage for $100,000.  When you made your payments you mostly paid the interest so at the time of the foreclosure you owned $97,000 on the loan you signed.  \\n\\nAfter it is foreclosed the bank/lender sells the house for $85,000.  \\n\\n     $97,000  (amount you promised to pay)\\n -     85,000  (amount the lender got for selling the house)\\n____________\\n     $12,000   (the amount still owning on the note you signed)\\n\\nThey can sue you to recoup the amount they lost.\\n\\nAlso, when a house is foreclosed the house now \"belongs\" to the Lender.  It is no longer your house.  If the bank sells the house for a profit (more than you owe) they keep the difference.  After all, they just sold THEIR house.\",\"Your information has been passed to the RIAA.\",\"Tough question.\\n\\nMany native Americans receive financial compensation, yet many are poor, uneducated drunks, and many get pregnant at a very young age.

I have straight A's for it, except for one C, in an \"elective.\" There was a professor who didn't give us information on how we were doing until the day before the official allowable withdrawl date, then encouraged us to re-write our test and gave out better grades for it rather than withdraw. However, he had a thing against people from my particular major, and after stringing us along gave me (oh joy) the highest grade from my department.... a C. The other students got D's and F's. However, people giving similar responses from other departments got A's and B's. After this, my department changed it's recommended electives for my type of degree to a similar course taught elsewhere. My department head, after reviewing my situation, accepted the course for the elective credit needed toward my degree (the policy for a Master's level was an A or B only) so that I could just move on and not worry about it.

With control comes responsibility, and often times people don't want to take responsibility.

If you're loan payment is higher than the 5-5.5% you can get from the bank or CD, then you're losing money on the spread.  In other words, the loan is costing you money.   On the other hand, if you had your money invested in something that gave you an average annual return that exceeded the loan rate, then I would advocate keeping the loan because you're making money on the spread.\\n\\nThe other issue is whether your student loan is fixed or adjustable.   Student loan rates will be going up about 1.5% in the next few months.   If that affects you then it may be even more motivation to go ahead and pay it off.   Ultimately, you just have to decide if you can invest the money for more than the loan payment with a reasonable low risk (based on what you're saying your risk factors are) because if not, then paying on the loan while you make less from the bank doesn't make sense.\",\"No One Can Cheat Death .....
